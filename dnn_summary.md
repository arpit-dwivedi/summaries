# What is a neural network?
Neural networks, a biologically-inspired programming paradigm which enables a computer to learn from observational data. It is inspired from th human brain which consists of 100 billion cells called neurons, connected together by synapses. So as the name suggests, **Neural**-> neuron, or something which contains number, has inputs and outputs. and **Network**-> a systematic way in which these neurons are connected to learn from observational data.
