* The basic problem that these bots try to solve is to become an intermediary and help users become more productive.
* It’s not just a chatbot, it’s like your virtual personal assistant.
* The time has already come for businesses to treat chatbots as one of the marketing tools of this generation.
* Chatbots are like our personal assistants who understand us and can be microconfigured. They remember our likes and dislikes and never tend to disappoint us by forgetting what we taught them already, and this is the reason why everyone loves chatbot.
* Lots of features can be added to the chatbot painlessly without having your users update your chatbot app.
* In chatbots, everything is API-based, so you just fix the issue in the backend, deploy the changes in PRODUCTION, and woaah—issue fixed for your users without any worry. You save lots of time from user-reported bugs as well.

## Components of a Chatbot and Terminologies Used

These terminologies will be used frequently when we actually start building our chatbots:
* **Intent :** What will be the intention of user to use the chatbot/what is he asking for?
* **Entities :** Intents have metadata about the intent called “Entities.” Entities could represent as a quantity, count, or volume. For example: Order me a shoe of size 8. There could be two entities here:
                 
                 Category: Shoe
                 
                 Size: 8
* **Utterances :**    They are different forms of the same question/intent your user may show.
* **Training a bot :**   Training essentially means to build a model that will learn from the existing set of defined intents/entities and utterances on how to categorize the new utterances and provide a confidence score along with it.
* **Confidence Score :**  Every time you try to find what intent an utterance may belong to, your model will come up with a confidence score. This score tells you how confident your machine learning model is about recognizing the intent of the user.
